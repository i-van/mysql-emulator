# MySQL Emulator

The package emulates a MySQL database from within Node.js, specifically designed for e2e testing.

Try it out at the [playground](https://i-van.github.io/mysql-emulator/).

âš  The library is still under active development.
It means that some features are not working and may be considered as invalid syntax or ignored.

âš  Known limitations:
- No right join
- Default order might differ (always use `ORDER BY` when the order matters)
- Column names might differ, f.e. `count(u.id)` => ```COUNT(`u`.`id`)``` (aliases fix it)
- No timezone support

ðŸ“ƒ TODO
- [ ] `ALTER` statement (in most cases `ALTER` even is not needed, `synchronize` will do all the work)
- [x] Foreign key constraints
- [ ] Fill `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables
- [x] `DELETE ORDER BY field LIMIT number`
- [x] `UPDATE ORDER BY field LIMIT number`
- [x] `SELECT GROUP BY position/alias`
- [x] `SELECT ORDER BY position/alias`
- [ ] Implement the most used functions

## Usage

Just start from:
```bash
npm install mysql-emulator
```

Then it's ready to go:
```javascript
import { query } from 'mysql-emulator';

await query(...);
```
